# METAL PRICE ANALYSIS

## Project Description:
We are going to explore predictive indicators for various metals with a focus on titanium. This would involve
using financial metrics like daily moving average (DMA), Pearson correlation coefficient, and time-shifted
data (ex. Does past 5 days of copper prices help us predict next day’s silver- is some metal’s historical price a
leading indicator for another metal?). Metal prices are also related to energy prices. We will add other pricing
data as available and relevant based on our research.

Metal prices are determined  by variable and fixed costs. The key input of metal production is energy,
for example; if we are able to follow energy prices trends such as gas, electricity or coal therefore 
we could assume that these prices will impact the final price of the metal because in order to produce
a metal, energy input is needed.

Depending on the manufacturing process of the region, some metals are produced by a form of burning coal while 
others by electrical induction which means melting with a magnetic field.

There are many other costs of production that we can use to analyze the final price of metals in the market
so this project is an exploratory tool to identify the most influential and accurate inputs.

## What is the code for?
We are turning the data into a chart easy to visualize, in this case we are using
candlestick charts. The daily data is transformed into a visualized structure.

We use daily commodity data for copper, gold, silver and oil.
For titanium we use monthly prices because Titanium is not traded as a non tangible asset
in contrast with the rest. 
The trade if titanium is done in the traditional supply chain physical market. We 
load the datasets into the program.
