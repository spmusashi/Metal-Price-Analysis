METAL PRICE ANALYSIS

Project Description:
We are going to explore predictive indicators for various metals with a focus on titanium. This would involve
using financial metrics like daily moving average (DMA), Pearson correlation coefficient, and time-shifted
data (ex. Does past 5 days of copper prices help us predict next day’s silver- is some metal’s historical price a
leading indicator for another metal?). Metal prices are also related to energy prices. We will add other pricing
data as available and relevant based on our research.
