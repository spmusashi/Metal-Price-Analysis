# Communication Plan

Chat and updates on WhatsApp. We will turn assignments to our designated team on Canvas when it is
available.
In case WhatsApp fails, we will communicate in Slack.
Team meetings on Zoom- We chose Zoom because as ASU students we have basically unlimited use of this
resource and it allows us to share the plan.
