# Communication Plan

## How will we communicate? 
Our primary form of communication is texting on WhatsApp due to its ease of use. We will also call each other if necessary. 
Backup: In case WhatsApp fails, we will communicate in Slack
If we need to share each other’s screens, we will use Zoom- a resource available to ASU students. 

## Turning in assignments
We will turn assignments to our designated team on Canvas when it is available. As Edward lives in a later time zone (PST), he will be responsible for final submissions.

## Contingency Plan for Team Member Unavailability 
Hard dependencies will be minimized by prudent folder management.
We will build the respective functions we have proposed. And our project responsibilities will be split up by our knowledge, software development capabilities, and availability to work on the project.
As Adrian would be the main source of domain-specific knowledge regarding titanium pricing, he could contribute more on the research rather than development side. 
We will strive to split the tasks involved in this project so that we can faithfully apply all the content that we are learning as the class goes along.
