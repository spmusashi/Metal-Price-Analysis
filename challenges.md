# Anticipated Challenges


## Technical Challenge:
### For Edward:
- I think I will need a refresher on statistics and additional research if I want to quantify the uncertainty
associated with our predictions. To the best of my knowledge, I’ve only back tested to try to see if
the model matches historic data, but I’ve never actually coupled predictions with associated
uncertainty.
-Another technical leap for me would be to systematically assess the back-testing of our model. I’ve
only eyeballed predictions vs. historical data but I’ve never actually written code for uniform rule-
based analysis.
- I will also need to learn new mathematical formulas to code based on Adrian’s research.

### For Adrian:
- Evaluation of the initial functionality should be made and corrected if necessary. Is a Daily Moving
Average (DMA) a valuable metric or should we rectify a different metric?
- Definitively any form of coding is a great challenge.
- Are the moving prices accurate in relation to the industry?
- Are the dependencies of the project reliable information?
