A git branch allows us to experiment in each individual work without the risk to alter the main branch. 

Creating a branch for each feature and a nice to have feature would be the ideal way to work as a team because each member manages their own time and workflow independently. 

Our team is in opposite time zones and has varying levels of coding experience. Working in the main could be challenging therefore working in branch per feature is  the best strategy.

Eventually, the branches are merged  into the main branch.
